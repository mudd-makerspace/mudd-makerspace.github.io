<h1 id="mudd-makerspace-policies">Mudd Makerspace Policies</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>On this page, you will find information on how to use the makerspace. These rules are meant to make the space safe, inviting, and effective for all students and for all projects. When you sign up to join the makerspace, you are agreeing to follow these rules, and to help build the maker community through your use of the space. Remember that it is a privilege - follow the honor code and act with respect for the room, the tools, and most of all your fellow students.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="reimbursements">Reimbursements</h3>
<ul>
<li>We offer $100 per person, per project. For a single project, the maximum allowed funding is $300. Funding approval is determined with the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/mM0Ho2kkGnmzj9Jv1">project petition form</a>. If you do not receive approval with this form, reimbursement is not guaranteed. As an individual, you may only have funding for one project at a time. Team projects must verify that all members listed are active participants. You may receive funding for an individual project and a group project at the same time, but all project funding remains at the leadership’s discretion.</li>
<li>A project is viewed as completed when you deliver an (informal) write-up with pictures and information about your project, to be displayed on the website and to help future makers. </li>
<li>When there are parts that you want to buy for a project, either buy them yourself and fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/8Rb888cmWaUV7qaj2">reimbursement form</a>, or if you don’t want to buy materials directly and get reimbursed, fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/a2Hki4hfWitAUHXq2">materials request form</a>. If you have any questions, contact makerspace-leadership-l. </li>
<li>We will not fund projects that are mandatory for a course (notably extensions of E4, E11, E80, E155 and clinic projects). All other cases (ie. projects that are continuations or prerequisites of work done for a course) will be looked at on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to store your project in the makerspace, fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BhR0atpDZaVXY37I2">project storage form</a>. This form must be completed to store anything in project storage. Please fill out the form.</li>
<li>Your project must fit on the shelves- if it cannot, it is too large to be stored in the makerspace. </li>
<li>Project storage lasts for an academic year. At the end of the year you must remove your project. You will get email reminders, but if you do not remove your project, or have an approved exception (ie, we usually extend project storage over the summer for students on campus for research- come talk to us), we do not guarantee the safety of your project. It may be thrown away, or recycled into stock parts. Please get your project at the end of the year- we don’t want to throw anyone’s project away, but space limitations mean that we cannot store anyone’s project indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The physical space limits the projects and storage we can support. Your project must be able to fit on the storage shelves without overflowing. </li>
<li>We do not allow projects which cannot be returned to storage (either in the space or outside of it) after every use, nor do we allow projects which damage the space.</li>
<li>Do not use the makerspace for projects for which this room is not appropriate- this includes projects with large quantities of machine grease, paint, food, fumes which pose safety risks, electrical hazards, plants, beads, or glitter.</li>
<li>All projects must follow ASHMC bylaws for use of funding. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/xZQdCQUqr74EaqwV2">safety quiz</a> to gain access, and read this document in full.</li>
<li>Please report any injury by filling out this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/geQyD0PWXY2NuAef1">form</a>. By using this information we can better improve the safety of the space. </li>
<li>Check in on the sheet outside the door, and check out when you leave.</li>
<li>Be aware of the space around you whenever you or anyone else is working.</li>
<li>Do not leave anything (tools or materials) in the common space when you leave the room. Leave the space as clean as you found it, and please clean any messes you find.</li>
<li>Read safety data sheets and standard operating procedures for everything before you use it for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ppe">PPE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Personal protective equipment is stored throughout the makerspace. Safety glasses are located on the front shelving unit, and near the computer and sewing machine. Wear safety glasses whenever anyone in the makerspace is using power tools.</li>
<li>A face shield and dust masks are found on the front shelving unit.</li>
<li>Hearing protection ear muffs (not the fuzzy kind) are located on the front shelving unit. Use them as appropriate.</li>
<li>Latex gloves are available for using epoxies, wood stain, and other messy things. Do not wear gloves when using power tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-tools">Power Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>To access power tools, you must first pass an <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/hJhWEqKHfBNOOQpp2">additional safety quiz</a>, testing particular knowledge of all of the tools in the cabinet. You will then be given the combination to the cabinet.</li>
<li>It is an honor code violation to share the combination with anyone who has not passed the power tool safety quiz. Do not share it.</li>
<li>Power tools will be marked with fluorescent spray paint, denoting that they belong in the cabinet. Put them back in the cabinet when you are done.</li>
<li>Read the standard operating procedures for any tool before you use it. Be sure you know exactly how the tool works and all of the ways it can hurt you or those around you. Always wear close-toed shoes, safety glasses, and never loose or dangling clothing.</li>
<li>Power tools must be used with a buddy (who does not need to have passed the power tool quiz, but who does need to have passed the general safety quiz, and must be sober and able to assist in an emergency) whether in the makerspace or not.</li>
<li>We are encouraging people who use power tools without a buddy to self-report.</li>
<li>You are responsible for the tool the entire time it is out of the cabinet, and it must be put back into the cabinet as soon as you are done with it.</li>
<li>We are not allowing power tools to be checked out of the space.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flammables-cabinet">Flammables Cabinet</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want to store propane, or any other flammable materials as part of a project, it is your responsibility to talk to makerspace leadership so that we can store those materials in the flammables cabinet.</li>
<li>If you want access to the flammables cabinet for stock materials stored there, notify leadership and we will arrange access or give you a key. Access is contingent on other students’ availability, so plan ahead. Access is not guaranteed at all hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wood-stains-spray-paint-and-fumes">Wood Stains, Spray Paint, and Fumes</h3>
<ul>
<li>These materials can be kept in the makerspace, but all use of wood stains or spray paints must occur outside in a well ventilated area. </li>
<li>Put down paper (found in the back of the makerspace) to protect the ground from paint.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to research chemicals you are using, and use them outside if they pose any danger- the makerspace has no ventilation (even in the spray booth), so please err on the safe side.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spray-booth-and-marcrocketry">Spray Booth and MARC/Rocketry</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The spray booth is not currently operational because the filters need changing. If you want to use this, please talk to Penny Manisco in the Chemistry Department. She can be found in Jacobs 2314, or at pmanisco (a) hmc [dot] edu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to use the rocketry equipment, it is fully your responsibility to get trained, arrange the safe use of equipment, and notify relevant parties: makerspace leadership (mudd-makerspace-l), Penny Manisco (pmanisco (at) hmc [dot] edu), Theresa Lauer (tlauer (at) hmc [dot] edu), and Prof Spjut (spjut (at) hmc [dot] edu). Logistical and safety arrangements must be made with, and approved by them. When and if you have their approval, we will give you the key to the MARC and rocketry equipment. Otherwise it is to remain locked for the safety of everyone using the makerspace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>If found engaging in behavior which endangers yourself or others, you will be subject to a community service penalty. This will take the form of an hour spent cleaning or organizing the makerspace. (Optimally, this will occur during office hours, or otherwise will work with your schedule.) </li>
<li>If a makerspace user fails to complete this community service, or is found breaking the rules 3 times (even with community service completed), they will lose swipe access, and will be barred from entering the makerspace for 2 semesters. At the end of that time they will be able to retake the safety quizzes and regain their access.</li>
<li>Punishments are subject to leadership’s discretion- if unsafe behavior is especially egregious, or results in injury, loss of access may be immediate, or last for more than 2 semesters.</li>
<li>The space is not supervised, so constant enforcement is not feasible. Students realizing that they have broken the rules, especially the buddy system for power tools, or having engaged in unsafe behavior are encouraged to self-report.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please ask before downloading especially large files.</li>
<li>There is an Oculus Rift connected to the computer; this is available for students looking to develop games for it.</li>
<li>Use of the computer for gaming or other frivolous purposes is not prohibited, but comes second to anyone else attempting to use it for an academic or nonacademic project. If this becomes an issue gaming, etc. will become prohibited. Make sure you logout of facebook or any other accounts when you are done working.</li>
<li>Be aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools.</li>
<li>Please don’t use this computer for piracy or inappropriate content. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sewing-machine">Sewing Machine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please replace bobbins after use if you use unusual thread.</li>
<li>Be especially sure that you don’t leave needles on the floor. There is a magnet available for finding them if dropped.</li>
<li>Be aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools.</li>
<li>No beads or glitter are allowed in the makerspace due to the difficulty of cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electronics-table">Electronics Table</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick up all of your wire scraps. Return unused components to their bins after working.</li>
<li>There is a water bottle to keep sponges wet for soldering. There are also sinks down the hall.</li>
<li>Be aware that some solder has lead. Don’t eat it. Use the smoke absorber to reduce fumes.</li>
<li>Don’t leave soldering irons on if they are not being used. Please coat the tips in solder when you are done to prevent them from oxidizing.</li>
<li>If you are going to use a significant number of a single component, fill out a project reimbursement request rather than emptying our common supplies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-table">Main Table</h3>
<ul>
<li>The only things that belong on this table are the two power reels. All other items must be removed after use.</li>
<li>Be aware of the plastic top of the table- it is replaceable but expensive. If your work will melt, burn, cut, stain, or stick to the tabletop, put down paper or do it outside. Butcher paper for covering the table can be found in a cart on the back wall.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tool-checkout-policy">Tool Checkout Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any tool can be checked out, provided you have access to it.</li>
<li>When you take a tool out of the makerspace, sign the tool out with the tool checkout sheet on the door.</li>
<li>All tools must be returned within one week of checking them out. If you are still using it, you may check it out again.</li>
