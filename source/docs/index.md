#HMC Makerspace
## About

The Mudd Makerspace is a student-run club for providing access to tools, resources, space, and storage to work on extra-curricular projects. We are dedicated to making this a space where all students feel comfortable working on a variety of projects, from electronics to sewing or artistic endeavours. In the makerspace, you can find sewing machines, drills, saws, soldering irons, electronics components, and space to use them all.

## Location
