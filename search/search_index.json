These rules are meant to make the space safe, inviting, and effective for all students and for all projects. When you sign up to join the makerspace, you are agreeing to follow these rules, and to help build the maker community through your use of the space. Remember that it is a privilege - follow the honor code and act with respect for the room, the tools, and most of all your fellow students. Projects Reimbursements We offer $100 per person, per project. For a single project, the maximum allowed funding is $300. Funding approval is determined with the project petition form . If you do not receive approval with this form, reimbursement is not guaranteed. As an individual, you may only have funding for one project at a time. Team projects must verify that all members listed are active participants. You may receive funding for an individual project and a group project at the same time, but all project funding remains at the leadership\u2019s discretion. A project is viewed as completed when you deliver an (informal) write-up with pictures and information about your project, to be displayed on the website and to help future makers. When there are parts that you want to buy for a project, either buy them yourself and fill out the reimbursement form , or if you don\u2019t want to buy materials directly and get reimbursed, fill out the materials request form . If you have any questions, contact makerspace-leadership-l. We will not fund projects that are mandatory for a course (notably extensions of E4, E11, E80, E155 and clinic projects). All other cases (ie. projects that are continuations or prerequisites of work done for a course) will be looked at on a case by case basis. Storage If you wish to store your project in the makerspace, fill out the project storage form . This form must be completed to store anything in project storage. Please fill out the form. Your project must fit on the shelves- if it cannot, it is too large to be stored in the makerspace. Project storage lasts for an academic year. At the end of the year you must remove your project. You will get email reminders, but if you do not remove your project, or have an approved exception (ie, we usually extend project storage over the summer for students on campus for research- come talk to us), we do not guarantee the safety of your project. It may be thrown away, or recycled into stock parts. Please get your project at the end of the year- we don\u2019t want to throw anyone\u2019s project away, but space limitations mean that we cannot store anyone\u2019s project indefinitely. Limitations The physical space limits the projects and storage we can support. Your project must be able to fit on the storage shelves without overflowing. We do not allow projects which cannot be returned to storage (either in the space or outside of it) after every use, nor do we allow projects which damage the space. Do not use the makerspace for projects for which this room is not appropriate- this includes projects with large quantities of machine grease, paint, food, fumes which pose safety risks, electrical hazards, plants, beads, or glitter. All projects must follow ASHMC bylaws for use of funding. Safety Take the safety quiz to gain access, and read this document in full. Please report any injury by filling out this form . By using this information we can better improve the safety of the space. Check in on the sheet outside the door, and check out when you leave. Be aware of the space around you whenever you or anyone else is working. Do not leave anything (tools or materials) in the common space when you leave the room. Leave the space as clean as you found it, and please clean any messes you find. Read safety data sheets and standard operating procedures for everything before you use it for the first time. PPE Personal protective equipment is stored throughout the makerspace. Safety glasses are located on the front shelving unit, and near the computer and sewing machine. Wear safety glasses whenever anyone in the makerspace is using power tools. A face shield and dust masks are found on the front shelving unit. Hearing protection ear muffs (not the fuzzy kind) are located on the front shelving unit. Use them as appropriate. Latex gloves are available for using epoxies, wood stain, and other messy things. Do not wear gloves when using power tools. Power Tools To access power tools, you must first pass an additional safety quiz , testing particular knowledge of all of the tools in the cabinet. You will then be given the combination to the cabinet. It is an honor code violation to share the combination with anyone who has not passed the power tool safety quiz. Do not share it. Power tools will be marked with fluorescent spray paint, denoting that they belong in the cabinet. Put them back in the cabinet when you are done. Read the standard operating procedures for any tool before you use it. Be sure you know exactly how the tool works and all of the ways it can hurt you or those around you. Always wear close-toed shoes, safety glasses, and never loose or dangling clothing. Power tools must be used with a buddy (who does not need to have passed the power tool quiz, but who does need to have passed the general safety quiz, and must be sober and able to assist in an emergency) whether in the makerspace or not. We are encouraging people who use power tools without a buddy to self-report. You are responsible for the tool the entire time it is out of the cabinet, and it must be put back into the cabinet as soon as you are done with it. We are not allowing power tools to be checked out of the space. Flammables Cabinet If you want to store propane, or any other flammable materials as part of a project, it is your responsibility to talk to makerspace leadership so that we can store those materials in the flammables cabinet. If you want access to the flammables cabinet for stock materials stored there, notify leadership and we will arrange access or give you a key. Access is contingent on other students\u2019 availability, so plan ahead. Access is not guaranteed at all hours. Wood Stains, Spray Paint, and Fumes These materials can be kept in the makerspace, but all use of wood stains or spray paints must occur outside in a well ventilated area. Put down paper (found in the back of the makerspace) to protect the ground from paint. It is your responsibility to research chemicals you are using, and use them outside if they pose any danger- the makerspace has no ventilation (even in the spray booth), so please err on the safe side. Spray Booth and MARC/Rocketry The spray booth is not currently operational because the filters need changing. If you want to use this, please talk to Penny Manisco in the Chemistry Department. She can be found in Jacobs 2314, or at pmanisco (a) hmc [dot] edu If you want to use the rocketry equipment, it is fully your responsibility to get trained, arrange the safe use of equipment, and notify relevant parties: makerspace leadership (mudd-makerspace-l), Penny Manisco (pmanisco (at) hmc [dot] edu), Theresa Lauer (tlauer (at) hmc [dot] edu), and Prof Spjut (spjut (at) hmc [dot] edu). Logistical and safety arrangements must be made with, and approved by them. When and if you have their approval, we will give you the key to the MARC and rocketry equipment. Otherwise it is to remain locked for the safety of everyone using the makerspace. Consequences If found engaging in behavior which endangers yourself or others, you will be subject to a community service penalty. This will take the form of an hour spent cleaning or organizing the makerspace. (Optimally, this will occur during office hours, or otherwise will work with your schedule.) If a makerspace user fails to complete this community service, or is found breaking the rules 3 times (even with community service completed), they will lose swipe access, and will be barred from entering the makerspace for 2 semesters. At the end of that time they will be able to retake the safety quizzes and regain their access. Punishments are subject to leadership\u2019s discretion- if unsafe behavior is especially egregious, or results in injury, loss of access may be immediate, or last for more than 2 semesters. The space is not supervised, so constant enforcement is not feasible. Students realizing that they have broken the rules, especially the buddy system for power tools, or having engaged in unsafe behavior are encouraged to self-report. Equipment Computer Please ask before downloading especially large files. There is an Oculus Rift connected to the computer; this is available for students looking to develop games for it. Use of the computer for gaming or other frivolous purposes is not prohibited, but comes second to anyone else attempting to use it for an academic or nonacademic project. If this becomes an issue gaming, etc. will become prohibited. Make sure you logout of facebook or any other accounts when you are done working. Be aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools. Please don\u2019t use this computer for piracy or inappropriate content. Sewing Machine Please replace bobbins after use if you use unusual thread. Be especially sure that you don\u2019t leave needles on the floor. There is a magnet available for finding them if dropped. Be aware of students around and the danger they or their equipment may pose to you. You are required to wear safety glasses if anyone is using power tools. No beads or glitter are allowed in the makerspace due to the difficulty of cleaning. Electronics Table Pick up all of your wire scraps. Return unused components to their bins after working. There is a water bottle to keep sponges wet for soldering. There are also sinks down the hall. Be aware that some solder has lead. Don\u2019t eat it. Use the smoke absorber to reduce fumes. Don\u2019t leave soldering irons on if they are not being used. Please coat the tips in solder when you are done to prevent them from oxidizing. If you are going to use a significant number of a single component, fill out a project reimbursement request rather than emptying our common supplies. Main Table The only things that belong on this table are the two power reels. All other items must be removed after use. Be aware of the plastic top of the table- it is replaceable but expensive. If your work will melt, burn, cut, stain, or stick to the tabletop, put down paper or do it outside. Butcher paper for covering the table can be found in a cart on the back wall. Tool Checkout Policy Any tool can be checked out, provided you have access to it. When you take a tool out of the makerspace, sign the tool out with the tool checkout sheet on the door. All tools must be returned within one week of checking them out. If you are still using it, you may check it out again.","title":"Policies"},{"location":"policies/#mudd-makerspace-policies","text":"","title":"Mudd Makerspace Policies"},{"location":"policies/#overview","text":"On this page, you will find information on how to use the makerspace.

This is a problem because all of the tables have corners, and players at the corner are usually at a disadvantage. Andrew Bishop, Elizabeth Poss and Nancy Wei designed and built a table to solve this problem. For a detailed description, see here . Biometric Lock by Jenny Smith Jenny Smith wanted to make a biometric lock because she can never find her key and is alwasy carrying things when she walks up to her door. THe final product looks awesome. For a detailed description, see here . Copper Electroplating by Kathryn Chan Kathryn Chan was inspired to do this project from the jewelry made by Enchanted Leaves, and used their resources page as a guide. She collected leaves from around the campus, and electroplated them. The final results look amazing! For a detailed description, see here . Cute Compute Cluster by Kalani Duran, Adam Grobman, Katharine Larsen and Kaveh Pezeshki The goal of this project was to provide the team with a simple physical distributed computing platform for education. They wanted experience writing algorithms that can take advantage of multiple cores over a (very) slow interconnect. Additionally, it provided experience with surface-mount soldering, as the board included tight-pitch QFP ICs as well as many 0402 capacitors and resistors. For a detailed project description, see here . 2017 Fall Mirror by Valerie Kwee Valerie made a mirror with dynamic LED lighting during the summer. She used a circular saw to cut the wood base and used cement glue to attach smaller blocks of wood to frame an octagonal mirror. She lined the smaller blocks with an LED strip, then cut out an acrylic sheet the same size as the wood base and lined it with a one-way mirror sticker. Then she used glued the sheet to the wood frame parallel to the mirror, about 1 inch away. Portable Gas Stove for Use With a Wok by Ryan Gibbs Ryan modified a portable gas stove so that it can be used with a wok efficiently. Ryan made a flame focus ring using stainless steel pastry rings he purchased online. For a complete description, see here . EDC by Ben Baral Ben built a bar for his dorm using more than 30 feet of 2x4s, some plywood, caster wheels, and chalkboard panels from Lowe's. The only tools used were a chop saw, a cordless drill, and a table saw. First, he made the frame by cutting consistent lengths of wood on the chop saw, then he drilled the frame together, then he cut the panels to size and attached them. It's pretty sturdy, though not completely square due to warp in the 2x4s.","title":"Project Showcase"},{"location":"showcase/#2018-spring","text":"","title":"2018 Spring"},{"location":"showcase/#south-table-by-andrew-bishop-elizabeth-poss-and-nancy-wei","text":"Many games played around tables at South involve students in standing in a circle.

Motivation First, I will motivate the project. The electric stoves in Sontag are not designed to accommodate wok cooking\u2019s need for high heat. A round bottom will only make limited contact and there is no open flame to vaporize oil as you toss your food. This problem can be solved by purchasing a portable gas stove. We then run into another problem. Western style gas stoves typically burn using a ring; the heat is directed away from the center, forming a circular \u201cring\u201d of flame. When we place a curved wok over this style of flame, the majority of the heat \u201crolls\u201d off of the sides, causing inefficient heating of the surface. To solve this, we can attempt to focus the flames into the center, such that we get maximum absorption, while avoiding that roll off. There is also the issue of a round bottom wok being incompatible with the flat surface of the generic stove. To summarize the requirements of the system: Open flame to vaporize oils as you toss foods; provides characteristic smoky flavor Must focus the flames towards the center of the wok to avoid heat roll off Must be able to balance the wok without the use of hands To ensure you can vaporize oils, we want to have a stove with a high heat output. This is measured in BTUs. The maximum portable burner strength that I found was 15,000 BTUs. Higher BTU stoves are available, but they are not compact in size and designed for outdoor use. I ended up going with a Sterno 50108 Portable Butane Stove. This stove uses a dual ring design; there is a smaller flame ring that is inside of a larger flame ring. This provides more even heating over the cooking surface. It was not necessary for this project, but nice to have for general use. To support the wok and focus the flame, I then purchased two stainless steel pastry rings. To determine sizing, I measured inner ring and gave it half an inch clearance on each side. The second pastry ring was sized by looking at the metal cooking grate on the stove. As long as you choose a ring that fits on the grate, it should be fine. Modifications Modifications were then done, pictured below. I cut a series of lines around the diameter of the 4 inch steel ring, about halfway down its height. The panels that were formed were folded towards the center, creating a type of nozzle. Later, I realized the air flow was insufficient for complete combustion, so I cut air supply holes round the bottom. Two of the panels are upright so they catch on the metal cooking grate; this causes the nozzle to remain static as I cook. Next, I had to modify the larger ring for the wok to sit on. This ring has to stay still as I cook; I toss the pan around vigorously, if the ring is loosely attached, it can fall off and burn things. To avoid this, I started off by setting the ring on top of the grate. I then marked where the ring touched the grate. Keep in mind I did this with the thicker side, which I believed would mate with the grate better. After marking the grate, I cut notches into both the ring, and the grate. The fit is shown below. I also cut flaps in this ring to provide flame outlets. When it was previously sealed, the flame was forced out of the bottom. After making these cuts, the grate and ring should fit together tightly, but it should still be removable with a little effort. After all of these modifications are made, we are ready to fire up the stove after we get some butane. Final Result Here is the results from the finished product. As you can see it has a high, focused flame, that is capable of reaching up and touching tossed foods. The gaps caused by the two standing flaps caused some leakage, but I am happy as it is. For extra safety during operation, I purchased some insulating material to wrap the butane canister; the focused heat may cause the bay to heat up more, so this is just an added layer of protection.

However, after my longboard got stolen from outside my room I decided this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. The obvious solution for opening my door was to install a biometric lock system. After consulting with Darian Joso and Christopher McElroy (who have done similar projects) I purchased the following materials: I wired the fingerprint sensor to the OSOYOO nano like so: (picture from another person on amazon) There\u2019s an Adafruit library online with code that can be used to run the scanner. I also bought the following attachment for the servo motor gear: Yes, unfortunately the shipping was 2x the cost of the part. After all that, it didn\u2019t even fit the gear of the servo like it was supposed to. I ended up supergluing it on there. This part was key for getting a shaft coupled to the motor that could be taped to the doorknob. I merged the adafruit fingerprint code with some servo starter code (I\u2019d be happy to send this to anyone) and uploaded it to the board. The nice thing about using a servo motor is that it can be powered from the \u201cArduino\u201d board and doesn\u2019t need extra power. The hardest part was probably mounting the servo to the door in a way that was temporary but sturdy. I tried several things that didn\u2019t work. Eventually, I broke down a 3D printed a mount: This worked really well with command strips. The whole setup plugs into the wall via a single usb plug. Here is a picture of the finished product: The finger print is mounted to the outside of the door via a command strip and the wires just go around the door.","title":"hidden"},{"location":"project-files/2018-spring/copperplating/copper-electroplating/","text":"Copper Electroplating Leaves, by Kathryn Chan I was inspired to do this project from the jewelry made by Enchanted Leaves, and used their resources page as a guide. I collected leaves from around campus and pressed them between the pages of a book for a week to let them dry. After this, I coated the leaves with a layer of polyurethane, glued a small copper jump ring to one end, and coated each with a layer of carbon graphite paint. For the electroplating solution, we dissolved 150g of copper sulfate crystals into a solution of 30mL 98% sulfuric acid that was diluted to 750mL. We hung the piece with a segment of titanium wire attached to a wire bar that was able to rest across the rim of the beaker to keep the piece suspended in the solution. We attached the negative cable of the power supply to the piece and the positive cable to a 12 gauge copper wire coiled in the solution. We ran the electroplating process once per day for several days and experimented with different levels of current. (We turned the voltage knob all the way up and allowed the amps setting to be the limiting factor.) Each piece was left in the solution with the power supply at a low current for 6 to 7 hours. [1] At 0.1 amps, most of the piece had plated (except for a small graphite-exposed spot) and had a thickness of about 0.5 mm. [2] The surface area of the second piece was somewhat larger, and a setting of 0.2 amps resulted in similar thickness. We suspect that some of the graphite paint had flaked off into the solution before it could be plated, resulting in black splotches. [3] The surface area of the third piece was similar to that of the first. We initially set the power supply to 0.5 amps for about 10 minutes to prevent the graphite paint from flaking, then to 0.25 amps for the remainder of the process. The resulting plated piece did not flake significantly, and had a thickness of around 1mm. After electroplating, the pieces had an appearance similar to that of [1]. Polishing the pieces with a wire brush connected to a rotary tool resulted in a shinier appearance, as seen with [3].

Rapid Prototyping (3D Printing) At this time, we do not allow 3D printing as the makerspace cannot deal with the fumes from 3D printing. We are working to come up with an alternative. We have a Ulitmaker 2 Extender+ 3D printer for rapid prototyping needs. How to Start a Print We use a Google calendar to manage the print process. Here is the calendar. Notice that it requires a Harvey Mudd College email address. Before starting the print, you should make a calendar event with the approximate time of your print, and your name and a contact phone number. That way if someone else sees that your print has failed they can contact you, and people will know when they can print. Do not block out time for future prints- fill in time once you have started your print, but don't sign up for future times that you may or may not show up for. The printer requires its own software to run, found here . There you will need to pick the nozzle diameter (currently 0.8 mm) and material (PLA). It needs to be exported to an SD card (there is one at the printer). Then, put some of the glue on the build plate to get your print to stick. Without this, it may come detached while printing and fail. For safety reasons, we are limiting the printer to PLA filament. We have a large quantity of stock filament that you are welcome to use- if you want to buy your own filament, please check with us to make sure it's a compatible type with safer fumes.

We have a Ulitmaker 2 Extender+ 3D printer for rapid prototyping needs.","title":"Rapid Prototyping (3D Printing)"},{"location":"resources/tools/#how-to-start-a-print","text":"We use a Google calendar to manage the print process. Here is the calendar. Notice that it requires a Harvey Mudd College email address. Before starting the print, you should make a calendar event with the approximate time of your print, and your name and a contact phone number. That way if someone else sees that your print has failed they can contact you, and people will know when they can print. Do not block out time for future prints- fill in time once you have started your print, but don't sign up for future times that you may or may not show up for. The printer requires its own software to run, found here . There you will need to pick the nozzle diameter (currently 0.8 mm) and material (PLA). It needs to be exported to an SD card (there is one at the printer). Then, put some of the glue on the build plate to get your print to stick. Without this, it may come detached while printing and fail. For safety reasons, we are limiting the printer to PLA filament. We have a large quantity of stock filament that you are welcome to use- if you want to buy your own filament, please check with us to make sure it's a compatible type with safer fumes.","title":"How to Start a Print"},{"location":"resources/tools/#tool-list","text":"Tool Location Angle grinder Power tool cabinet Bench top power supply Electronics table Box cutters Tool chest Channel locks Tool chest Chisels Tool chest Circular saw Power tool cabinet Combination wrenches Tool chest Corded drills Power tool cabinet Crescent wrenches Tool chest Crosscut saw Tool chest Crowbars Tool chest Dremels Power tool cabinet Files Tool chest Hacksaw Tool chest Hammers Tool chest Hand jigsaw Tool chest Hex sets Tool chest Hole saws Tool chest Hot glue gun Supplies shelf Impact driver Power tool cabinet Jigsaw Power tool cabinet Level Tool chest LiPo charging Supplies shelf Mallets Tool chest Oscilloscope Electronics table Palm sanders Power tool cabinet Pipe wrench Tool chest Pliers Tool chest Portable drill Power tool cabinet Reciprocating saw Power tool cabinet Router Power tool cabinet Scissors Tool chest Screw drivers Tool chest Socket set Tool chest Solder pot Electronics table Soldering irons Electronics table Speedsquare Tool chest Vise grips Tool chest X-acto knives Tool chest If there are any tools that you think we need, contact mudd-makerspace-leadership-l","title":"Tool List"}]}
